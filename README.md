# DataScience BootCamp at [Coven Labs](http://curators.ng/datascience/)
Coven Labs is teaching 10,000 youths from marginalised communities to become Data Scientists and AI Professionals from 2018-2020

We offer high impact Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Education in Africa. Attend a highly competitive Data Science and AI Boot Camp and double your value as a developer while you build cool bots, API services, automation systems and have fun with our team building exercises.

Applications are now open. Selection is on rolling basis.

# Structure
Classes are divided into Beginners and Intermediate Class.
Classes start with introducing the students to computer programming and building up into manipulating datasets. Focus is placed on attempting to solve a real-life problem while introducing the various aspects of the Data Science Process. Every Bootcamp ends with a Capstone project presented by the various teams.

## Data Science Toolbox

Mastering the Data Science process requires having a set of basic tools to process your data, test your hypothesis and extract meaning for insights.  For this course, we will show examples primarily using Python and its libraries, and sometimes R, JavaScipt or Java for specific topics. Students who have suggestions or prefernces for other tools should feel free to use them and share with the community. The ball is in your court. See below for the tool set for this course:
